One dimensional flywheel balancing cube (2016). Purpose: for fun:) Inspired with Cubli https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y

Hardware:
Adapted SToRM32-BGC camera gimbal controller. Gimbal motor drivers ware used as gate drivers for high amp driver. Controller board provided all necessary peripheral IOs connected to sockets. 

High amp driver was designed and created with home methods. Consist of 3 N-MOS / P-MOS half-bridges and hall effect current measurement circuit.
BLDC motor is a cheap RC plane motor.
Orientation sensor is a 3D gyroscope and accelerometer MPU6050.

Software:
   STM32: C++/C with GCC. MCU has 3 general task: Field oriented control of BLDC motor, communication and balancing algorithm. 
   PC: Qt 4.8. Is an interface providing debug information and sending controller configuration.
